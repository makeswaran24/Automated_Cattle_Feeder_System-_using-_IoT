PROJECT:Automated Cattle Feeder system using IoT
Project by :Makeswaran K,KPR INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Guided by : Dr.Jaikumar

OBJECTIVE :
To develop an automated cattle feeder system that ensures timely and precise feeding of livestock
by automating the distribution of food and water, thereby reducing manual labor and enhancing efficiency 
in cattle management.

METHODOLOGY
STEP 1: Identify the need for automation in livestock feeding, particularly in remote or large-scale farms.
STEP 2: Design the circuit using Arduino, RTC module, relay, servo motor, and DC water pump.
STEP 3: Write Arduino code to control the timing and operation of the servo motor and water pump.
STEP 4: Set feeding schedules using the RTC module for accurate time-based activation.
STEP 5: Interface the relay to control the power supply to the DC pump.
STEP 6: Test and refine the system to ensure automatic, reliable operation at scheduled intervals.

PROTOTYPE MODEL
Hardware Used: Arduino, RTC module, relay, servo motor, DC water pump.
Food Dispensing: At the scheduled time, the servo motor tilts the feed cup to release food.
Water Filling: The DC pump activates to fill the water container simultaneously.
Timed Delay: A predefined delay ensures proper intervals between feedings before the cycle restarts.
Scalability: The model can be extended to accommodate multiple animals or larger farms.
Future Scope: Integration with IoT for remote monitoring and control of feeding schedules.
